IOCipher Camera Example
================

This is an example app for the IOCipher framework, which provides encrypted virtual disks for Android. This app aims to show how to capture a still photo (as an in memory byte[] array) directly from the Camera sensor, store that as an encrypted JPEG file directly inside of IOCipher, and then later share that file as a stream directly from a ContentProvider.

This example does not handle proper password/phrase management. Please see our CacheWord library at https://github.com/guardianproject/cacheword for help with that.
